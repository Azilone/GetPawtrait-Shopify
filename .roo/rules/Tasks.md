# Implementation Plan for GetPawtrait.com

## **Introduction**

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the GetPawtrait.com MVP. Starting with the existing Shopify CLI template and development store, we'll work through five phases to create a fully functional application that transforms pet photos into stylized artwork using AI and integrates with Printify for production.

Each phase is broken down into major tasks and detailed subtasks that you can execute sequentially. As a beginner with Remix, Shopify, and Prisma, you'll find explanatory notes throughout to help you understand the technical concepts.

## **Phase 1: Setup and Configuration **

### **1.1 Environment Verification**
- [X] **Verify development environment**
  - [X] Confirm Node.js and npm/Bun installations are compatible with Shopify CLI
  - [X] Verify Shopify CLI is correctly installed (`shopify version`)
  - [X] Test that the development server starts without errors (`npm run dev` or equivalent)
  - [X] Ensure the app loads in your Shopify development store admin panel

### **1.2 Project Initialization**
- [X] **Review and understand the template structure**
  - [X] Examine the root files (`package.json`, `shopify.app.toml`, `vite.config.ts`)
  - [X] Understand the app directory structure (`app/routes`, `app/shopify.server.ts`)
  - [X] Review authentication flow (`routes/auth.$.tsx`, `routes/auth.login`)
  - [X] Familiarize yourself with Remix concepts (routes, loaders, actions)

- [X] **Set up version control**
  - [X] Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
  - [X] Create `.gitignore` to exclude node_modules, .env, and other sensitive files
